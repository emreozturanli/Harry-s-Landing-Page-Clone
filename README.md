# Harry-s-Landing-Page-Clone
In this project I tried to do a landing page like Harry's. 

<hr> 

* This is one of my first clone projects. 
* It is not responsive.
* I tried to learn and use <b>CSS Flexbox</b>.
* I learned how to create a <b>NAVBAR</b>.
* I used <b>CSS Position</b> property to create a better layout.
* I learned how to use <b>background image</b> properly.
* I tried to implement <b>box-shadow</b> on some elements to make it seem better.
